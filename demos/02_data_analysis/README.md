In this demo, i briefly introduced [FsLab](fslab.org), a data science package collection and project incubation space for F#.

I showed what we love about the data flow in F# analytical scripts by using 2 [FsLab-endorsed packages]():
- [Deedle](https://fslab.org/Deedle) as the central data frame library in F# fore data access and manipulation
- [Plotly.NET](https://plotly.net), a mature .NET interface for the powerful plotly.js visualization library for all kinds of 
two read structured data

I used those two libraries to read a csv file and visualize its contents.
