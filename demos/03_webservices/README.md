in this demo, i showed two of the web services we are running. Both of them are built via the superb SAFE Stack.

The first one, http://imlp.bio.uni-kl.de simply makes a data analysis pipeline accessible for users with no programming background.

The second one, [SWATE](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/Swate) is a webservice designed for using the [office.js](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js) javascript API for Excel to support researchers in annotating their research with metadata.

There were multiple talks about web programming in F# on this conference that give better introduction and references for web programming with F#, but here are the top dogs anyways:
